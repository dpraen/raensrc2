### what is mautic?

Mautic is an open source marketing automation platform. Like its competitors, Hubspot, Marketo, Pardot and others, it can be used to automate marketing processes that are repetitive and difficult - email marketing, social media marketing, lead generation, tracking and scoring.

The difference between Mautic and its competitors is that Mautic is completely free, and the source code is available, making it theoretically possible to customize it at a source code level if necessary.

Getting started is quite straight forward if you are familiar with Hubspot or Marketo. If you're completely new, check out their getting started guide:

### conclusion

If your company doesn't have marketing automation, you should get it. There are a lot of options, but Mautic is definitely to look into, potentially saving thousands of dollars per month. Self hosting isn't for everyone, but it will give you complete control over your marketing automation software.
